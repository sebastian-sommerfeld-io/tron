= 02 - Architecture Constraints
:description: Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process.

To develop and run the application you need a Linux environment with Docker (and Docker Compise) installed. A local link:https://go.dev[Go] installation is not needed because everything related to Go is delegated to a Docker container. So a link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/[Docker and Docker Compose installation] is mandatory. All other tools are treated the same way as Go (meaning all other tools run in Docker containers as well). Development takes place on link:https://www.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu].
