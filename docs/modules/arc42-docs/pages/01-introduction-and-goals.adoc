:description: Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 

Tron is a command line interface for automating and streamlining recurring tasks which are otherwise done through the Jira web interface. Tron encapsulates the link:https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis[Jira Rest API] through the command line and provides simple ways to automate (or at least dramatically speed up) recurring tasks. This tool is designed to simplify the work and enhance productivity of Jira administrators.

// Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
// These include

// * underlying business goals, 
// * essential features, 
// * essential functional requirements, 
// * quality goals for the architecture and
// * relevant stakeholders and their expectations

== Requirements Overview
Todo: generate some requirements information based on the github issues.

// .Contents
// Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
// of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
// (with version number and information where to find it).

// .Motivation
// From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
// improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

// .Form
// Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
// If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

// Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


// .Further Information
// See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

// == Quality Goals

// .Contents
// The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
// We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
// They are not necessarily identical.

// Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

// .Motivation
// You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
// Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
// If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

// .Form
// A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

== Stakeholders
Since this is a personal project that acts as a training ground with a meaningful purpose the only stakeholder is myself. This may change in the future if I decide to adopt this app for work purposes. But at the moment this is an independent app without any ties to other systems.

// .Contents
// Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

// * should know the architecture
// * have to be convinced of the architecture
// * have to work with the architecture or with code
// * need the documentation of the architecture for their work
// * have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

// .Motivation
// You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
// Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
// These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

// .Form
// Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

// |_<Role-1>_ |_<Contact-1>_ |_<Expectation-1>_
