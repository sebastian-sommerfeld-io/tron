Start and stop the docker stack containing the Jira runtime.

== Overview

The script starts and stops the docker compose stack used for the local jira
instance. The `local/tron:test` image is build before starting Jira.

=== Script Arguments

* _$1_ (string): Command (`start`, `logs`, `stop`)

=== Script Example

[source, bash]

----
./tests.sh
----

== Index

* <<_index,index>>

=== index

When starting Jira, the instance is provided with a h2db and is populated with a
license, users and projects so there is no need re-run the setup wizard all the time. This data
defines a baseline which is the same everytime this test-stack starts.

The only issue is, that there is no data visible in the UI after starting up because  there is
no (or at least no uncorrupted) index. A new index must be created in the foreground triggered
through the link:https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/8.22.6[Jira REST API].

==== Example

[,bash]
