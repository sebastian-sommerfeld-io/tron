Build, test and run the  Tron locally.

== Overview

The script builds, tests and runs the `tron` app locally. The script runs all
testcases, builds a Docker container and runs the app inside the Docker container.

=== Script Arguments

* _$@_ (...): The same parameters as `tron` app.

=== Script Example

[source, bash]

----
./tron.sh --help
----

=== go

Wrapper function to encapsulate `go` in a Docker container (`go` commands
are delegated to the link:https://hub.docker.com/_/golang[golang] Docker image).

The current working directory is mounted into the container and selected as working directory
so all files are available to `go`. Paths are not preserved. The working directory is placed
in `/app` (in the container) to make sure paths to the go app are the same everywhere (Go
wrapper container, Dev Container and all images built from `src/main/Dockerfile`). Keep in
mind that most functions in this script (which call this `go` wrapper function) first `cd`
into the `go` folder. So most of the time the current working direktory is not `src/main`
(where this script is placed) but `src/main/go`.

The go wrapper container runs with the current user.

==== Example

[,bash]
----
go version
----

==== Arguments

* *...* (String): The `tron` commands (1-n arguments) - $1 is mandatory

==== Exit codes

* *8*: If param with `go` command is missing

=== format

Format go source code. Before formatting, the function ``cd``s into the
`go` folder.

=== test

Run all test cases and security scanner.

Before testing, the function ``cd``s into the `go` folder.

=== build

Build `local/tron:dev` Docker image.

=== run

Run `tron` app in Docker container.

==== Arguments

* *...* (String): The `tron` commands (1-n arguments) - $1 is mandatory

=== init

Initialize the go application in needed. Before initializing, the function
``cd``s into the `go` folder.
