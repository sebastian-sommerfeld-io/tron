== About this project
Tron is a command line interface to automate tasks otherwise done through the Jira web interface. The project encapsulates the link:https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis[Jira Rest API] through a command line and provides simple ways to automate (or at least dramatically speed up) recurring tasks.

To develop and run the application you need a Linux environment with Docker installed. A local Go installation is not needed because everything related to go is delegated to a Docker container. Development takes place on Ubuntu.

=== About the project name
Tron is a security program from the 1982 American science fiction action-adventure film by same name, to monitor communications between the  Master Control Program (MCP) and the real world. He is the main digital protagonist of the first film. 

== How to use this project
To use this app and execute some commands against a Jira instance run this command:

[source, bash]
----
docker run --rm --network=host sommerfeldio/tron:latest

# Example commands which do more than just display help-texts
docker run --rm --network=host sommerfeldio/tron:latest license view --baseUrl="http://localhost:8080" --user="<THE_USERNAME>" --pass="<THE_PASSWORD>"
----

In case you want to access a Jira instance that is not running on your local machine, you need to update the `--baseUrl`. Plus you can probably omit the `--network=host` flag.

=== Local IDE Setup
For information on how to set up your local development environment, see link:https://www.sommerfeld.io/docs/projects/tron/main/index.html[IDE Setup] on www.sommerfeld.io.
